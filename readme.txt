To run the program first install the packages provided in "requirements.txt" 
then run the "search.py" file and give a relevant keyword which must have a 
wikipedia page.

Wait until all the URLs are fetched (average 200 URLs are fetched).
Fetching words from these URLs may take a while.
Then the result is displayed.
